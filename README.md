# Next.js router.push Issue in Dynamic Components

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using `router.push` within dynamically imported or client-side rendered components in Next.js.  The navigation may fail if the router isn't fully initialized.

## Problem

The `router.push` method in Next.js's `useRouter` hook might not function correctly when used in components that are loaded after the initial page render. This can happen in situations involving dynamic imports or client-side routing scenarios.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the `router` object is ready before attempting navigation. This can be done by checking if `router.isReady` is true before using `router.push`.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to the `/about` page.
5. Click the "Go back Home" button.
6. Observe that the navigation doesn't work as expected in the initial implementation but works correctly after the fix.

This example showcases a practical solution to a frequently encountered Next.js routing problem.
